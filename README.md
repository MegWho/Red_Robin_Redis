# Red_Robin_Redis
A tiny Redis-inspired key-value store built using Python. Through this project, I'm trying to explore the core concepts behind "in-memory databases" using simple CLI. Added a Tkinter-based GUI interface for better visualisation. Supports basic Redis-like commands (SET, GET, DELETE).
